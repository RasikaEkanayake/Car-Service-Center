Supplier manager manage all supplier details. supplier manager collect data from suppliers and add them to the database using a form and he can view the list of registered suppliers at anytime using view list interface. The supplier manager can find suppliers details directly from search using search bar and also supplier manager can view complete profile using view supplier button.
