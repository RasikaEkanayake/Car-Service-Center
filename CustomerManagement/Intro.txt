This function was created because the service center wanted to enter the details of the customers to the system and generate a customer profile for each individual and wanted to count the no of services done by the service center using a particular Customer ID within a month. So that it allows the customer to use the same customer ID for the services of different vehicle he/she owns to, and benefits could be given for them.
